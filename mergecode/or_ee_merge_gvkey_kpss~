check:
The merged data has many duplicated 
rf_id, or_,ee_, or_gvkey, ee_gvkey

After drop the duplicated, one or_name has two or more assignee,
we drop the ee_name
1. If there is ee_gvkey, we keep the ee which does have a gv_key,
2. if none of them has a gvkey, keep one on the top after sort by 

input data: or_ee_trans_tax_state_country.dta

proc sort data = or_ee_trans_tax_state_country out=or_ee_gvkey;
